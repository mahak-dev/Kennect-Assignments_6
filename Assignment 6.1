Assignment 6.1

Description :- 

Create a schema and ER diagram for cricket information web-app using draw.io (or any other tool) and submit the diagram
Requirements:
N countries, M players per country, X stadiums, every match that takes place creates score for countries and players which our analysts need to analyse.
Store data in such a way that most of the analytics are made possible
Write SQL or Mongo queries for following reports
Player’s strike rate -> Total Runs divided by matched played
Player’s avg run-rate -> Total Runs divided by overs played
Player’s Top 3 matches according to strike rate
Couple of teams who have played most matches with each-other
Given two teams as input, success rate of Team1 against Team2
Create 2 more queries on your own

Schema :- 

CREATE TABLE Country (
  CountryID  INT  PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Player (
  PlayerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  CountryID INT NOT NULL,
  MatchesPlayed INT,
  TotalRuns INT,
  OversPlayed INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (CountryID) REFERENCES Country (CountryID)
);

CREATE TABLE Stadium (
  StadiumID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Match (
  MatchID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  StadiumID INT NOT NULL,
  Date DATE NOT NULL,
  Team1 VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Team2 VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Result VARCHAR(100),
  FOREIGN KEY (StadiumID) REFERENCES Stadium (StadiumID)
);

CREATE TABLE PlayerScore (
  ScoreID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  MatchID INT NOT NULL,
  PlayerID INT NOT NULL,
  RunsScored INT,
  OversBowled INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (MatchID) REFERENCES Match (MatchID),
  FOREIGN KEY (PlayerID) REFERENCES Player (PlayerID)
);

ER diagram :- 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Write SQL queries for following reports

1. Player’s strike rate -> Total Runs divided by matched played

SELECT PlayerID, TotalRuns / MatchesPlayed AS StrikeRate FROM Player;

2. Player’s avg run-rate -> Total Runs divided by overs played

SELECT PlayerID, TotalRuns / OversPlayed AS AvgRunRate FROM Player;

3. Player’s Top 3 matches according to strike rate

SELECT PlayerID, MatchID, RunsScored / OversBowled AS StrikeRate FROM PlayerScore
ORDER BY StrikeRate DESC LIMIT 3;

4. Couple of teams who have played most matches with each-other

SELECT Team1, Team2, COUNT(*) AS MatchesPlayed FROM Match
GROUP BY Team1, Team2
ORDER BY MatchesPlayed DESC LIMIT 2;

5. Given two teams as input, success rate of Team1 against Team2

SELECT Team1, Team2, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN Result = 'Win' AND Team1 = 'Team1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN Team1 = 'Team1' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS SuccessRate
FROM Match
WHERE (Team1 = 'Team1' AND Team2 = 'Team2') OR (Team1 = 'Team2' AND Team2 = 'Team1')
GROUP BY Team1, Team2;

6. Extra - Top 5 Countries with the most number of players

SELECT CountryID, Name, COUNT(*) AS TotalPlayers
FROM Player p
JOIN Country c ON p.CountryID = c.CountryID
GROUP BY CountryID, Name
ORDER BY TotalPlayers DESC
LIMIT 5;

7. Extra - Total runs scored in each stadium

SELECT StadiumID, Name, SUM(RunsScored) AS TotalRunsScored
FROM Match m
JOIN PlayerScore ps ON m.MatchID = ps.MatchID
GROUP BY StadiumID, Name;
