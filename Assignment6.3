Design a Doctor's Database

Doctor's Clinic Entity RelationShip Diagram - 

Schema:- 

CREATE TABLE Patient (
  PatientID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  ContactInfo VARCHAR(100)
  -- Additional patient-related columns as needed
);

CREATE TABLE Doctor (
  DoctorID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Specialization VARCHAR(100)
  -- Additional doctor-related columns as needed
);

CREATE TABLE Clinic (
  ClinicID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  Address VARCHAR(200)
  -- Additional clinic-related columns as needed
);

CREATE TABLE TimeSlot (
  TimeSlotID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  StartTime TIME NOT NULL,
  EndTime TIME NOT NULL,
  ClinicID INT NOT NULL,
  DoctorID INT NOT NULL,
  IsAvailable BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (ClinicID) REFERENCES Clinic (ClinicID),
  FOREIGN KEY (DoctorID) REFERENCES Doctor (DoctorID)
);

CREATE TABLE Appointment (
  AppointmentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  PatientID INT NOT NULL,
  TimeSlotID INT NOT NULL,
  AppointmentDateTime DATETIME NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (PatientID) REFERENCES Patient (PatientID),
  FOREIGN KEY (TimeSlotID) REFERENCES TimeSlot (TimeSlotID)
);

CREATE TABLE Doctor_Clinic (
  DoctorID INT NOT NULL,
  ClinicID INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (DoctorID, ClinicID),
  FOREIGN KEY (DoctorID) REFERENCES Doctor (DoctorID),
  FOREIGN KEY (ClinicID) REFERENCES Clinic (ClinicID)
);


Optimization Approach :-

Doctor Search Optimization:
By using the TimeSlot table, we can efficiently store and manage the availability of doctors in different clinics.
The IsAvailable column can be used to quickly filter available time slots for each doctor, allowing for fast doctor search queries.
By having a separate Doctor_Clinic table, we can store the mapping of doctors to multiple clinics efficiently.
This avoids duplicating doctor information across multiple records and optimizes storage.
Indexes can be added on relevant columns, such as DoctorID and ClinicID, to further speed up search queries.


Appointment Booking:
The Appointment table allows patients to book appointments at specific time slots. 
The AppointmentDateTime column stores the exact date and time of the appointment.
By associating PatientID with the appointment, we can track appointments booked by each patient,
including appointments at different clinics and with different doctors.
With this database design, doctor search and appointment booking can be efficiently managed, 
allowing patients to book appointments at their preferred clinics and with specific doctors based on available time slots. 
The database schema and optimizations ensure that the system can handle heavy doctor search usage while providing a seamless 
user experience for patients and clinic staff.
